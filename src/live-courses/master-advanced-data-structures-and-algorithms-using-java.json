The course has been launched to cater to the needs of students at the time of the quarantine period.. Our Algo.java Live Program the best solution for all budding programmers who want to gain expertise in DS & Algo or are appearing for their internship/placement interviews.</p><p>The Live Algo.java Program would ensure that students get to learn from the best mentors at the comfort of their homes, saving them from all the traveling hassles. It would allow the students to get all benefits of classroom learning right inside their homes.</p><p>With our Live Program, you can avail benefits like immediate doubt resolution from mentor, recorded video lecture after each class, hand-written mentor notes, and a lot more.</p><p>The classes start with a basic revision of recursion and Arrays. Advanced topics such as OOP(s), Complexity Analysis, Data Structures & Algorithms will be covered in the following classes.</p>",

Though, most of what CORE java means is being covered. The aim of the course is to help you with a smarter beginning. For being able to make web and mobile apps you need to learn frameworks. Android is one such framework for mobile apps. Please check out our Pandora and Elixir course for more details on these lines."
