          <strong>Summary</strong>
          <br /><br />
          First of its kind, our C++ Live course for beginners is a uniquely designed course in Data Structures and
          Algorithms to aid your journey right from the beginning to the very end in becoming the most skilled software
          engineers across the globe.Through these Live classes, the students will not only become more efficient with
          their solutions by optimizing space and time but will also provide them a firm base to excel in all their
          programming interviews. The core focus of these C++ classes is to maintain an equilibrium between theory and
          practical, thus providing the programmers with an ample amount of practice of questions based on Sorting,
          Searching, Greedy Algorithms, Divide and Conquer Algorithms and more.
